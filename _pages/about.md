Salve! I'm in my second year of grad school, studying CS at NYU Courant. My interests mainly lie in ML Engineering, particularly at the intersection of Large Language Models and Vision. I'm also currently working as an ML Engineering intern at [Keysight Technologies](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/home.html).

Previously, I studied Computer Science and Engineering at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). There, I worked as a Research Assistant under [Dr. Ravi Kiran](https://ravika.github.io/) at the Center for Visual Information Technology. My work involved devising novel techniques to obtain highly accurate contours around handwritten text in ancient Indic manuscripts, using Mask-RCNN and Graph Convolutional Networks. 

Outside of academics, I love photography, and by extension, nature. Check out some of my recent clicks [here](https://pranavtadimeti2000e7.myportfolio.com/)! I'm also fascinating in the history and development of languages, and I'm currently learning [Latin](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/pranavtadimeti) in my spare time.

I'm currently looking for Full-Time opportunities starting June 2024. If you think I'm a good fit for your team, feel free to reach out to me via the links below!
